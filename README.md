# About
Welcome to Brick Buster, a thrilling and challenging game that combines the classic arcade experience with exciting new features! This game will test your reflexes and hand-eye coordination as you navigate the paddle to smash bricks and rack up points.

Getting Started Brick Buster requires the following to run:

C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) CustomGraphics Library (This library includes some functionalities from built in library) Once you have everything set up, compile the source code (main.cpp) using your preferred C++ compiler and link it with the CustomGraphics library.

Gameplay The objective of Brick Buster is simple: use the paddle to hit the ball and break as many bricks as possible.
# Mechanics / Controls
Paddle Control: Use the A and D keys to move the paddle left and right. The paddle bounces off the edges of the screen, so you don't have to worry about it going out of bounds. Ball Movement: The ball bounces around the screen, changing direction whenever it hits a brick, the top or bottom of the screen, or the paddle. Brick Health: Bricks come in different colors and have varying degrees of health (indicated by color). Hitting a brick with the ball reduces its health. When a brick's health reaches zero, it breaks and awards you points. Scoring: Each successful hit on a brick earns you points. The number of points awarded depends on the brick's health: Regular brick (1 point) Brick destroyed in a single hit (5 points) Combo: Destroying bricks consecutively increases your combo meter. The higher your combo, the more points you earn for each subsequent brick break. Lives: You start with three lives. Every time the ball falls past the paddle, you lose a life. The game ends when you lose all your lives. Special Features Brick Buster boasts several features that enhance the gameplay experience:

Saving and Loading: You can save your game progress (including score, lives, combo, and remaining bricks) and resume later. Press S to save and load from a previously saved game at the beginning. Pausing: Take a break from the action by pressing P. The game will pause, and you can resume by pressing C. Quitting: If you're done playing, press Q to quit the game. High Scores: The game keeps track of your top five high scores. These scores are saved to a file, so you can compete against yourself and others. Multiple Brick Health Levels: Bricks have varying health levels (indicated by color), adding a strategic element to the game. Aim for the weaker bricks to rack up points quickly or target the stronger ones for a higher combo bonus.
